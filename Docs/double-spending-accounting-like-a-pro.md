# Double Entry Bookeeping Like a ~~Pro~~ Dev

Tracking expenses is not one of my favourite daily tasks, however it is a very
necessary one to keep wealth.

In the past I've been very diligent with my expense tracking and I've tried a
couple of approaches such as using a Spreadsheet or using specialized
applications such as [HomeBank](http://homebank.free.fr/en/index.php). They
worked up to a point but I was bugged by the amount of time they required to get
them right and the difficulty of addressing certain use-cases such as split
accounts or investments. So I gave up. The result was 4-years of basically
ignoring my finances.

But life's got more complex recently and so does my financial situation. I've
got more money to spend, I play with more financial products from stock to
crypto. I've also become a father and have unexplored expense areas ahead of me.
I live with someone and have shared expenses as well. I've started to feel
unconfortable with the feeling of not knowing how money is being spent, so I
started looking into alternatives. Enter double spending book-keeping.

## Starting point

- 5 banks, 7 checking accounts, 4 crypto exchanges, 3 broker platforms, 2
  e-money institutions.
- Some account shared with my life-partner.

Bookeeping use-case break-down:

1. Tracking expenses & income from and to private checking accounts.
1. Tracking expenses from creditors.
1. Tracking expenses from e-money institutions.
1. Tracking split expenses.
1. Tracking stock trades.
1. Tracking crypto trades.

For these use caesI want to be able to see the history of transactions, the
money flow but as well as see balances.

## Principles for a long-lasting, reliable, min maintainance double-entry bookkeeping system

I've stablished the following set of principles

1. Downloadable structured statements are the source of truth
1. Downloadable structured statements are never manually altered
1. The information of a downloadable structured statement never needs to be
   written manually into the ledger
1. Only expenditures for which there is no downloadable structured statements
   are written manually into the ledger
1. Categorized transactions should help determining fututre similar transactions
1. No need to tackle all use cases at once

## Post-clone initial configuration

Ideally, after cloning a repo I should be able to build whatever that repo
contains without the need of downloading or installing anything. The next thing
is

There are a number of things that need to be configured machine-wise so I like
to use a `./config` shell script to set-up a number of things:

- Git hooks.
-

## Automatic formatting of markdown files

## 

- Getting up & running after cloning

## Clearing state

Use the `cleared` state when a transaction has been "reviewed"

## Building a front-end for easy transaction reviewing.

## Augmenting bank statements
